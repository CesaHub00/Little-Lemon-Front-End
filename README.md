# **Little Lemon project**
End of Coursera's [*Meta Front-End Developer*](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer) course.

The main goal is to build a table reservation page for the Little Lemon restaurant website. 

On the Main page there will be:
- navigation and footer section, with the links to the other pages and the information on the restaurant;
- specials section, with weekly special offers.
  
On the booking page there will be a form with 4 required fields:
- Date
- Time
- Number of people
- Occasion (birthday or anniversary)

Once all the fields have been correctly filled in, by clicking on the reserve button the string "Booking has been confirmed!" will appear.

**Note: only the Home page, Boking page and the Confirm page are implemented; the About, Menu, Order Online and Login pages are placeholders.**
